ðŸ§® BMI Calculation
The app calculates BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))

The result is categorized as follows:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5 (Time to fuel up with some cosmic snacks!)
Normal: 18.5 â‰¤ BMI < 25 (Youâ€™re in the health galaxyâ€™s sweet spot!)
Overweight: 25 â‰¤ BMI < 30 (A little orbit adjustment might be in order!)
